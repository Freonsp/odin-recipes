		<p>Of course you like finger-lickin good crackpot chicken, but let's say your going to a big coockoff? A crockpot meal ain't fit so everyone can get a taste. Word of the wise is to be multi-cultural if <em>your not already</em>, so let me teach you how to make some bomb <em>enchiladas</em> to blow their expectations for your cooking skills. Honey, this isn't <em><strong>Hell's Kitchen</strong></em> you don't have to go all out making a "5-star meal". Somtimes the expensive foods don't really satisfy everyones  pallete and unless you make enough of it everyone may not get a plate. Sit down, grab a plate and don't be bashful, an enchilada comming  <a href="./recipes/enchiladas.html">right up</a> </p>
		
		<h4>Snack <em>or</em> Dessert?</h4>

		<p> I found this one from one of my good friends yang, its a good snack for your churrin and its not so sweet that it'll put you off. If your on a diet but don't mind a tease of cheat, you gotta try out the Youtiao, its a fried chinesse dough, its a long golden-brown deep-fried savory that taste like a churro but better. You can eat'm in the morning with breakfeast or at dinnner as a dessert, it won't keep ya churrin' up all day because of that sugar so don't worry. Let me show ya how to fry it  <a href="./recipes/youtiao.html">up</a>.
